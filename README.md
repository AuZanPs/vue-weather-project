# Weather Terminal v2.1

A retro-futuristic weather application inspired by classic VCR and Teletext "blue screen" interfaces from the 1980s and 90s.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Intelligent, Persistent Search:** A robust, four-stage sequential search engine that finds cities and countries, complete with an auto-retrying mechanism and "exact match" fallbacks.
* **100% Validated Suggestions:** Every search suggestion is pre-validated against the OpenWeatherMap API to guarantee it has available weather data, eliminating all "dead-end" results.
* **"Select & Save" Favorites:** A user-friendly favorites system that automatically saves selected locations to the browser's `localStorage` for quick access.
* **Authentic VCR Aesthetic:** A meticulously crafted design featuring the `VT323` font, a classic blue color palette, and a borderless, block-based layout.
* **Immersive UX:** Includes a one-time animated "System Boot" screen, a thematic "VCR Tracking" loading animation, and a subtle CRT screen effect for full immersion.
* **Pixel Art Icons:** Uses the `pixelarticons` library for a cohesive, low-resolution visual identity.

* **Language:** TypeScript
